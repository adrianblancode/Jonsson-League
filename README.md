You are about to embark upon a great adventure to steal the swedish royal treasures.
You are Jonsson, the mastermind behind the legendary Jonsson League, the most successful
thieves guild in the history of all universes.

You have entered the castle, and your mission is to find the throne room, steal as much 
treasure you can, and get out alive. On your quest, you will stumble upon many dangerous 
challenges that must be defeated.

To get information about the environment you are in, enter DESCRIPTION. You can also see
what you have in your INVENTORY or get the STATUS of Jonsson. You can TAKE and DROP items.

To move around in the castle, you can use GO, MOVE or WALK followed by the DIRECTION you
want to go.

Should you stumble upon an enemy, you can ATTACK them. If this game is too hard for you, 
you can just go ahead and QUIT.
```
